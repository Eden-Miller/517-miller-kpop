## My Favorite K-Pop Idols

Below, I've provided a very brief (and somewhat comedic) introduction to a few of my favorite K-Pop idols. Though I'm out of my K-Pop phase as of late, the subject matter made this exercise very fun. I hope you enjoy.

In the order of men: 
1. Beautiful K-Pop Boys
2. Everyone else
3. Elon Musk (very bottom of list)
